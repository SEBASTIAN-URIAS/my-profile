				<p>
					¡Hola! I'm Sebastian. Nice to meet you!
				</p>
				<p>
					Welcome to my space, I'll guide you through my career, my hobbies, and my goals!
				</p>
				<p>
					I like travelling and immersing myself in new cultures; making me always eager to know where my next destination will be!
				</p>
				<p>
					Currently, I'm pursuing an international business career, studying Business Administration in France at <a href="https://www.essec.edu/en/" target="_blank">ESSEC Business School

				<h2>My hobbies</h2>
				<p>
					I love travelling! I love visiting countries in unconventional ways to get to experience local cultures in a more authentic way.
				</p>
				<p>
					I began travelling around the world at the age of 10 years old. And ever since that experience, I haven't stopped visiting new countries every year! From family trips to solo backpacking.

				<h2>My career</h2>
				<p>
					I studied in the Mexican school system until middle school, when I took my first exchange program to the United States. There was the first time I was exposed to a foreign culture.
				</p>
				<p>
					In high-school, I spent a semester in Montpellier, France, where I learned the french language and culture.
				</p>
				<p>
					Forward to 2020, when the pandemic hit. I was fresh out of high-school and not looking to start college online, so I thought about taking an exchange in Japan. So I did, for a year!
				</p>
				<p> 
					I'm currently pursuing an international business career by studying Business Administration at Essec in Cergy, France. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="card-grey">
				<h2>My goals </h2>
				<p>
					I look forward to expand my Mexican company to the international panorama, as well as giving shape to my international entrepreneurship projects. Feel free to discuss them with me if you're interested!
